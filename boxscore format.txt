Boxtop - Flexible Basketball Boxscore Format


This format is designed to allow storage of multiple boxscores in a single file. 

The concept for this format is loosely based on Retrosheet's baseball "Box Score Event Files" (BSEF format; see http://www.retrosheet.org for details) but has been adapted for basketball.

What follows is a list of identification fields. Anything listed in ALL CAPS is variable data. The .csv files created by boxtopNCAA.py strictly follow this format, but that is not required. Tools written to parse this format should be written such that the order of the fields does not matter, and missing fields must be tolerated.

=====================================

1. Format fields


gamebxt   (sentinel to denote the start of a new boxscore)
version,NUMBER   (NUMBER always 1 for now)

=====================================

2. Information fields

info,date,MONTH/DAY/FOURDIGITYEAR
info,dayofweek,DAY OF THE WEEK
info,rteam,ROADTEAMFULLNAME
info,hteam,HOMETEAMFULLNAME
info,neutralsite,YES or NO (if omitted, or blank, interpret as "NO")
info,title,OPTIONAL USE FOR PLAYOFF GAMES (example: 1964 NBA Finals Game 1)
info,arena,ARENA
info,city,CITY
info,state,STATE
info,country,COUNTRY
info,attendance,ATT
info,ref,REFEREE NAME (one line per ref)
info,starttime,00:00PM
info,timezone,ET/CT/MT/PT
info,radio,RADIO INFORMATION
info,tv,TELEVISION INFORMATION
info,note,MISC NOTES ON THE BOXSCORE OR THE GAME
info,prelim,NON-NBA GAME THAT PROCEEDED OR FOLLOWED THIS GAME (if applicable)
info,event,SPECIAL EVENT (e.g. Bob Cousy Day, etc.)
info,techs,TECHNICAL FOULS not included in player/coach data (e.g. Techs assessed on a team's bench)

=====================================

3. Coach fields

coach,rteam|hteam,ID,FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME,TECHNICALFOUL

*Note that "rteam|hteam" means that either rteam or hteam must appear in that location

ID = format used by https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/ (bill-walton-1)
https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/bill-walton-1.html
For UCLA players the IDs should match exactly.
For non-UCLA players "99" is used, so there could be incorrect duplicates of opposing players.

=====================================

4. Player statistics fields


A blank indicates that that statistic is not available.

stat,rteam|hteam,player,ID,FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME,MIN,FGM,FGA,FTM,FTA,3FGM,3FGA,PTS,OREB,REB,AST,PF,BLOCKS,TURNOVERS,STEALS,TECHNICALFOUL

=====================================

5. Team statistics fields


tstat,rteam|hteam,MIN,FGM,FGA,FTM,FTA,FG3M,FG3A,PTS,OREB,REB,AST,PF,BLOCKS,TURNOVERS,STEALS,TEAMREBOUNDS,TECHNICALFOUL

=====================================

6. Linescores (quarter-by-quarter results)


linescore,rteam|hteam,Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4,[OT],[OT2],...,:,FINAL

If you only know the final score (which for pro games are obtainable from several sources, including http://www.shrpsports.com) then you can shorten the format as follows:

linescore,rteam|hteam,FINAL


=====================================

7. Issues related to the box score

These are manually inserted as comments. Inconsistencies or special internal notes go here. General notes should be entered as "info,note,<the note>".

issue,TEXT STRING
