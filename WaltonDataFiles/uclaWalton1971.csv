issue,stats,LAT rebound totals do not add up correctly. St. Louis Post-Dispatch rebound totals add up correctly if the "team rebounds" figure is SUBTRACTED (in other words the "team rebounds" seem to have been double-counted in the overall team total). The individual rebound figures for each player are the same in both newspapers.
sources,Los Angeles Times & St. Louis Post-Dispatch
issue,Bill Paradoski not listed on Sports Reference in 1971 but is listed as a junior in 1972.
