issues,LA Times lists Drollinger with 3-3 FT and 13 points and Meyers with 0-0 FT and 10 points. 
issues,Press-Telegram lists Drollinger with 2-2 FT and 12 points and Meyers with 1-1 FT and 11 points.
issues,The Press-Telegram figures appear to be correct because they balance the season totals for both players as listed at the time by UCLA and are repeated on their web site and on Sports Reference.
